## respringmyi
###Â How does it work?
respringmyi works by using the WatchConnectivity framework, when you press the button on your Apple Watch, it sends a message to the iDevice, when the iDevice gets this message it sends a notification to the tweak (which is allowed to spawn processes, and that runs: ``killall -9 SpringBoard``

### How do I install this?
Copy the file: ``me.conorthedev.respringmyi.helper_1.0_iphoneos-arm.deb`` from ``./respringmyihelper/packages/`` to your iDevice, install with Filza or ``dpkg -i (filename``
Then, open Xcode, select your team for signing and run!

Enjoy :p
